# Zimbra_Schedulle_Delete_Script
I just had a problem in a zimbra 9, in which a client shared a wrong agenda to the whole domain and I wanted to delete the agenda without calling attention, that is, without sending the email warning that it was done, I found the method in the zimbra wiki but it is half complicated to do it by hand, so I decided to make a script of it :v, if you want to use it just keep in mind the following change this the seach_subject and the search_metadata must have a keyword or the complete phrase of the address book to be deleted, be careful because it will delete everything that matches, I SPECIFY IN THESE FIELDS, BOTH MUST HAVE THE SAME VALUE    SEARCH_SUBJECT="360"   SEARCH_METADATA="360"
